This project was created with the intent of helping artist appraise their artwork. The currency of appraisal is in euros. it works in a similar way to most of the image recognition systems however in this case I am hoping the A.i is able to identify similarities between images of diffrent arts that have the same price and estimate how much another image would be sold for. The categories in this case are spicific, there are 742 categories each representing diffrent price point as seen in the price folder. The system was trained om over 5,000 images of diffrent artwork although a large constituent of these are paintings.
